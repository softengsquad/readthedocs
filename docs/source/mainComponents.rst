Main Components
==================

The side drawer of the app features the building information tab, building search tab and the timetable/calendar tab.
Interactive Map

Interactive Map
------------------------------------------------
The interactive map provides a view of the Portsmouth and surrounding areas. The map displays university buildings, supermarkets and social buildings as markers on the map.

Tapping on a building marker opens the side panel, showing information about the building such as its address, floor plan and a button to favourite or unfavourite the building.
Timetable/Calendar

Timetable/Calendar
------------------------------------------------
The app allows the user to sign in with Google to display their university timetable within the app (subject to the user linking their port.ac.uk timetable with Google).

The user can view their timetabled sessions for the current day, previous days or days in the future. Each timetable entry displays the name of the session, the start and end times and the building and room number.

Building Search
------------------------------------------------
The search tab allows the user to find a specific building by search term. The user can also filter buildings by their type (university, supermarket, social, or all three) and also the building's favourite status.
