Welcome to Student Map's documentation!
===================================

The aim of the project is to provide University of Portsmouth students with an interactive map showing university buildings. The app allows the user to sign in with Google to display their university timetable within the app (subject to the user linking their port.ac.uk timetable with Google).

Although not yet implemented, the project aims to provide navigational features to the user, such as providing bus routes and walking paths to university buildings.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
